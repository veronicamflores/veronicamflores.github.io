      <h2>Hi! I'm Veronica Flores.</h2>
      <p class="pink-border border-r p-2">I like to think of myself as talented and accomplished in front and back-end development. 
        After years of being self-taught I pursued additional education 
        in an immersive boot-camp experience finessing software development 
        skills. I'm a recent graduate with experience building full scale 
        applications from start to finish. I am a passionate artist with a 
        knack for problem solving and debugging. Previously I contributed to  
        my local drama club, providing creative input on backdrops and set design. 
        I enjoy a good challenge and love developing applications that are fully 
        functional and watching them come to life.</p>
